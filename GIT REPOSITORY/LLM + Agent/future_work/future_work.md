# **Future work**

profiling, memory, tools, and action agent components. Additionally move beyond manual evaluation and enable scalable, intelligent agent selection, we propose an automated pipeline that combines prompt iteration, performance tracking, and weight-based agent optimization.

### 🔁 Multi-Round Prompting & Response Evaluation

Each task will trigger multiple rounds of agent responses. Using pairwise Euclidean distance and cosine similarity, the system will detect:

- **Stable agents** that consistently align with others  
- **Divergent agents** that require re-prompting or feedback

### ⚖️ Agent Weighting System

Agents will be assigned **dynamic weights per task**, updated as follows:

- **Increase weight** if the agent consistently aligns with the majority or human feedback  
- **Decrease weight** if the agent frequently diverges or produces speculative, low-confidence, or incorrect answers

This system will:

- **Track agent reliability** across task types (e.g., reasoning, planning, fact retrieval)  
- **Store task-agent-weight mappings** in a persistent database

### 🧠 Intelligent Agent Selection

When a new task is received:

- The system will **retrieve agents with the highest weights** for similar tasks  
- Only **top-performing agents** will be executed, reducing computation cost  
- Over time, this evolves into a **self-optimizing selection mechanism**

### 🔍 Data Mining and Clustering

All past interactions will be analyzed using:

- **Clustering of agent-task embeddings** to find performance patterns  
- **Association rule mining** to detect which agents are best suited for search, cluster, orannising, extracting, generating or classifying task.  
- **Trend detection** to anticipate when an agent’s performance is degrading or improving
